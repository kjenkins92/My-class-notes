# CSS File Overview and Duration of Work
This CSS file organizes a variety of style rules, including universal selectors, element selectors, and class selectors, with a focus on creating a simple, elegant layout for a webpage. Below is a breakdown of the duration needed for creating each section of the CSS file, assuming a basic webpage structure is already in place.

## 1. Universal Selector (* {}) – 5 minutes
Purpose: Resets margin and padding for all elements to ensure a consistent layout across different browsers.
Duration: This is a simple reset that takes minimal time to implement.



## 2. Element Selectors (body, h1, h2, main, li, a) – 15 minutes
Purpose: Style the most basic elements of the page, such as body text, headings, links, and the main container.
Duration: Defining background colors, fonts, and text formatting can be done quickly, but adjustments based on the design mockup may take some time.
Tasks:
Set up font family, font size, and base styles for body and headings.
Ensure the main section has appropriate padding.
Style list items (li) and links (a) for clean navigation.


## 3. Header and Footer (header, footer) – 20 minutes
Purpose: Style the header and footer, making sure they fit within the page's structure, including fixed positioning and line heights.
Duration: Slightly more complex, as it involves positioning the header as fixed and the footer as absolute. This can require some adjustment to ensure everything stays in place as expected.
Tasks:
Set background colors and borders.
Ensure proper height and line-height for centering content vertically.
Adjust fixed and absolute positioning.


## 4. Images and Figures (figure, img) – 10 minutes
Purpose: Make sure images and figure elements are centered and spaced evenly.
Duration: Simple styling of margins and alignment for images within the page.
Tasks:
Center images.
Add space around the figure element for visual appeal.


## 5. Sections (section) – 15 minutes
Purpose: Style individual sections of content with padding, margin, and background color.
Duration: Quick to style, but making sure sections flow well visually may require slight adjustments.
Tasks:
Set padding and margins for sections.
Apply background color and borders.


## 6. Form Elements (form, label, input, textarea, button) – 30 minutes
Purpose: Style the form elements for a clean and functional form layout.
Duration: More time-consuming, as it involves centering the form, adding borders, and ensuring good user experience (UX) for form fields, including input, textarea, and buttons.
Tasks:
Center the form within the page.
Add padding, borders, and radius for rounded corners.
Ensure input fields and buttons are aligned properly and look consistent.


## 7. Class Selectors (.text-center, .text-right) – 5 minutes
Purpose: Define simple utility classes for text alignment.
Duration: These are utility classes and take minimal time to implement.
Tasks:
Apply text alignment using class-based selectors.
Total Estimated Time: 1.5 – 2 hours
The overall complexity is moderate, and while each task is straightforward, adjustments based on the webpage structure and design mockup may require some extra time. This estimation assumes you have a clear design plan in place.
